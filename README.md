# Snowpack

[![CI](https://github.com/HGInsights/snowpack/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/HGInsights/snowpack/actions/workflows/elixir.yml)

<!-- MDOC !-->

Snowflake driver for Elixir.

Documentation: <http://hexdocs.pm/snowpack>

## Features

- Automatic decoding and encoding of Elixir values to and from Snowflake's ODBC driver formats
- Supports transactions, prepared queries, streaming, pooling and more via
  [DBConnection](https://github.com/elixir-ecto/db_connection)
- Supports Snowflake ODBC Drivers 2.22.5

## Usage

Add `:snowpack` to your dependencies:

```elixir
def deps() do
  [
    {:snowpack, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Make sure you are using the latest version!

```elixir
opts = [
  connection: [
    role: "DEV",
    warehouse: System.get_env("SNOWFLAKE_WH"),
    uid: System.get_env("SNOWFLAKE_UID"),
    pwd: System.get_env("SNOWFLAKE_PWD")
  ]
]

{:ok, pid} = Snowpack.start_link(opts)
Snowpack.query!(pid, "select current_user()")

Snowpack.query(pid, "SELECT * FROM data")
{:ok,
 %Snowpack.Result{
   columns: ["id", "title"],
   num_rows: 3,
   rows: [[1, "Data 1"], [2, "Data 2"], [3, "Data 3"]]
 }}
```

It's recommended to start Snowpack under a supervision tree:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.Application do
  use Application

  def start(_type, _args) do
    children = [
      {Snowpack, uid: "snowflake-uid", name: :snowpack}
    ]

    opts = [strategy: :one_for_one, name: MyApp.Supervisor]
    Supervisor.start_link(children, opts)
  end
end
```

and then we can refer to it by its `:name`:

```elixir
Snowpack.query!(:snowpack, "SELECT NOW()").rows
[[~N[2018-12-28 13:42:31]]]
```

## Data representation

```
Snowflake ODBC       Elixir
-----                ------
NULL                 nil
bool                 1 | 0
int                  42
float                42.0
decimal              #Decimal<42.0> # (1)
date                 ~D[2013-10-12]
time                 ~T[00:37:14]
datetime             ~N[2013-10-12 00:37:14]  # (2)
timestamp            ~U[2013-10-12 00:37:14Z] # (2)
char                 "Ã©"
text                 "snowpack"
binary               <<1, 2, 3>>
bit                  <<1::size(1), 0::size(1)>>
```

Notes:

1. See [Decimal](https://github.com/ericmj/decimal)

2. Datetime fields are represented as `NaiveDateTime`, however a UTC `DateTime` can be used for encoding as well
